# Mouse-cursor-control-using-facial-expressions.

The Human-Computer Interaction application i.e., cursor control using facial movements
works with just regular webcam. The system targets on using user’s facial movements. Its
free of hands, avoidance of wearable hardware or sensors. The application deeply centred
around facial landmarks prediction for face from eye-blinks and mouth movements detection
in a video. Actions like mouth open to activate or deactivate mouse control, Right Eye wink
to right click, Left Eye wink for left click, Squinting Eyes for activate or deactivate scrolling,
Head Movements (Pitch and Yaw) –scrolling or cursor movement. With the help of these
landmarks of the face make use of building corresponding features for further allowance to
detect certain actions, for detection of winking and blinking of eye using eye-aspect-ratio
and yawn and pout of mouth using mouth-aspect-ratio. The actions act as triggers for the
mouse control. The model mainly looks into two main factors while analysing, they are EyeAspect-Ratio (EAR) that helps for detecting winks and blinks etc. and Mouth-Aspect-Ratio
(MAR) to get to know the status of mouth either closed or opened.
